== Binaries

Our `kwctl` CLI tool is published via https://github.com/kubewarden/kwctl/releases[Github releases].

== OCI artifacts

For OCI artifacts, we publish everything in `ghcr.io` under
https://github.com/orgs/kubewarden/packages.

- https://github.com/orgs/kubewarden/packages/policies[`kubewarden/packages/policies/*`]
  are our policy WASM OCI artifacts.
- https://github.com/orgs/kubewarden/packages/charts[`kubewarden/packages/charts/*`]
  are our Helm charts as OCI artifacts. They follow SLSA standards.
- our container images are published as OCI images: `kubewarden-controller`, `policy-server`, `audit-scanner`, `kubectl`.
- there's also `packages/tests/*` containing artifacts used in e2e tests.

== Helm charts via HTTPS

Our Helm charts are published in the Helm chart HTTPS
repository at https://charts.kubewarden.io (they are without SLSA, or signatures, but
this type of Helm repository provides searching).
